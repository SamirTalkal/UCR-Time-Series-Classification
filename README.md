# UCR-Time-Series-Classification-
Python

Upload your Train dataset and test dataset at the respected places in csv format.
One can use any method to find the distance like DTW,Euclidean  etc , 
In my code I have use Euclidean ditance .
After that use KNN for classification to predict the accuracy .
